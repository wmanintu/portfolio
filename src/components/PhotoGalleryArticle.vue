        A curated collection of my favorite photographs captured during travels
        across the globe. Shot with a Canon Rebel T3i using primarily a 50mm
        f/1.8 for portraits and street photography, and a 70-200mm f/4 for
        landscapes and distant subjects.
        <br /><br />
        My photographic journey has taken me through Thailand's bustling
        markets, Taiwan's mountain landscapes, Korea's vibrant cities, and the
        scenic beauty of Georgia, USA. Each image tells a story of culture,
        adventure, and the moments that make travel unforgettable.
        <br /><br />
        Photography complements my passion for programmingâ€”both require
        attention to detail, creative problem-solving, and the pursuit of that
        perfect shot (whether it's a sunset or clean code).
